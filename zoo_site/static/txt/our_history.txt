The Zoo is one of the oldest zoos in Europe. It was opened on January 31, 1864 according to the old style and was then called the zoo.
The Zoo was organized by the Imperial Russian Society for the Acclimatization of Animals and Plants. The beginning of its existence is associated with the remarkable names of professors of the Moscow University Karl Frantsevich Roulier, Anatoly Petrovich Bogdanov and Sergei Alekseevich Usov.
The area where the Old Zoo territory is now located was called "Presnensky Ponds". A fairly wide Presnya River flowed here, and it was one of the favorite places of Muscovites' festivities — green hills, flood meadows, blooming gardens decorated the surroundings. To create a zoo by the majority of votes of the members of the Acclimatization Society, this particular site was chosen, since it was at an accessible distance for all Muscovites, including the poor. The territory of the Petrovsky Academy, for example, was more convenient and larger, but it would be far and expensive for most potential visitors to go there.
By the opening of the zoo, it contained 134 specimens of domestic animals, 153 specimens of wild animals and birds and 7 specimens of reptiles. The Russian fauna was best represented: bears, wolves, foxes, badgers, ferrets, martens, hares, squirrels, hedgehogs, deer, falcons, hawks, owls, owls, bustards, cranes, herons, ducks. The creators of the garden wanted to show the audience first of all our native nature. There were also exotic animals at the exhibition — 2 lions, a jaguar, 2 tigers, a leopard, a rhinoceros, an alligator.
Officially, the Zoo begins its history with the opening on February 13, 1864. Today we want to tell you about the people who stood at its origins – those who conceived the idea of creating the first zoological park in Russia and achieved the realization of their dreams.
Dedicated to the 65th anniversary of the Great Victory By the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, the Zoo's animal collection included 5,710 specimens of 425 species of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish. Some of the most valuable animals were immediately evacuated to the Sverdlovsk and Stalingrad zoological gardens and to the Caucasian Reserve.
The first reptiles were presented in the collection of the Zoo from the day of its foundation. These were two species - an ordinary snake and a tiger python - seven specimens in total, kept in terrariums of different pavilions, mainly in the "House of Birds" and "Aquarium". Sometimes, later, during various exhibitions, the number of reptiles in the Zoo reached 10 species and 50 specimens.
Animal collections of most zoos are traditionally limited only to representatives of vertebrates (type Chordates), while the greatest species richness of animals is concentrated in several types of invertebrates, which are usually absent in zoos. Keeping and exhibiting invertebrates significantly expands the possibilities of zoos to develop their collections and conduct educational and environmental activities and allows visitors to get acquainted with all the diversity of the animal world. This has long been understood in many countries, actively developing educational and commercial exhibitions of invertebrates, both in zoos and in independent institutions (insectariums, butterfly houses, etc.). In Russia, the Zoo was one of the first on this path. In 2013, 135 years have passed since the creation of the first insectarium in the Zoo.
In 1856, on the initiative of Professor A.P. Bogdanov of Moscow University, a Committee for the Acclimatization of Animals and Plants was organized in Moscow, which was later transformed into the Imperial Russian Society for the Acclimatization of Animals and Plants (IROAZHIR). The priority tasks of the Acclimatization Committee included the study of valuable invertebrate species that are promising for acclimatization in various regions of Russia: mulberry and other species of silkworms, Russian, Caucasian and Italian breeds of honey bees, medical leeches and river crayfish. To solve them in 1858. The Department of Invertebrates was created in the Acclimatization Committee. K.F. Roulier, A.P. Bogdanov, A.A. Tikhomirov, etc. Russian zoologists called for using the unique opportunities of zoo gardens to study promising species of useful invertebrates.
On February 13, 1864, the opening of the Zoo, created by IROAZHIR, took place, and already in 1868, the insects — caterpillars of the silkworm and their feeding techniques were demonstrated for the first time in the Zoo. On the initiative of Professor A.P. Bogdanov, the first research laboratory was organized in the Zoo in 1878. The Department of Aquariums and Terrariums was created in the laboratory, which actually gave rise to the future departments of the zoo: terrarium, aquarium and insectarium. The organization and maintenance of the first terrariums and aquariums in the laboratory was handled by the assistant of the Zoological Museum of Moscow University, who later became a famous Russian zoologist and academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Nikolai Viktorovich Nasonov (1855-1939). In 1878-79, the zoo's laboratory contained 81 species of terrestrial and freshwater invertebrates, including: 34 species of insects, 8 species of arachnids, 9 species of crustaceans, 15 species of mollusks, etc. In the autumn of 1879, the collection consisted of more than 300 specimens of invertebrates. In 1878. here, obviously, the first breeding of hawk moths in laboratory conditions was achieved - the lilac hawk moth Sphinx ligustri. Families of ants and hornets were kept in special observation cages.
At the Second Acclimatization Exhibition in 1878, 12 species of living invertebrates (water bugs, floating beetles and their larvae, dragonfly and diptera larvae, sponge, hydra, infusoria) from the laboratory's collection were shown to visitors of the Zoo for the first time. A special Sericulture Pavilion was set up at this exhibition, which then regularly hosted sericulture exhibitions until 1909, and the beekeeping department was organized for the first time. In the summer of 1884. A special beekeeping pavilion was opened to the public at the Zoo, where, in addition to various hive systems, beekeeping equipment and collections on honey bee biology, there were two observation hives with honey bee families. An apiary of 6 beehives was set up near the pavilion. Until 1912, the beekeeping pavilion of the Zoo regularly hosted summer exhibitions of beekeeping.
